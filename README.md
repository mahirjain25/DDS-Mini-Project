# DDS-Mini-Project
Digital simulation of an Automated Hospital Management System.


The project aims to digitise the "waiting room scenario", by implementing a priority queue.

A patient is given priority and ID upon enqueue, and appropriately, patients are dequeued in order of their degree of seriousness.

## Prerequisites
1. Logisim - to open the .circ file
2. Verilog - To compile the .v files
3. GTKWave- To view waveform in the .vcd file
