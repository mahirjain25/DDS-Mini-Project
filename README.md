# DDS-Mini-Project
Digital simulation of an Automated Hospital Management System.


The project aims to digitise the "waiting room scenario", by implementing a priority queue.

A patient is given priority and ID upon enqueue, and appropriately, patients are dequeued in order of their degree of seriousness.

To understand what the project really is in its simplest terms, refer to the Data FLow Diagram file.
