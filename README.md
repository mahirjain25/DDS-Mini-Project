# DDS-Mini-Project
Digital simulation of an Automated Hospital Management System.


The aim is to simulate a 'Emeregency Room Scenario' using digital components.
In essence, the project implements a priority queue using digital components.


To view the implementation, the following tools are needed:
1. Logisim 
2. Iverilog
3. GTKWave

Use logisim to open the '.circ' file.
Use verilog to compile the '.v' files and view a '.vcd' output in GTKWave.
